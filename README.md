## 🏥 Healthcare Resource Optimization Website

Imagine a tool that helps hospitals and healthcare heroes breathe easier during crises. This app uses smart time-traveling tech (time-series forecasting!) to predict exactly how many beds, ventilators, and oxygen tanks will be needed. It's like having a crystal ball for resource planning, ensuring that everyone gets the care they need, when they need it. \
Plus, it's a quick portal to research papers and even AI helpers like ChatGPT, making it a one-stop shop for healthcare professionals tackling tough challenges.
